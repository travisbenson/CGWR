# CGWR

CGWR, or Card Game Win Rate, is a simple Python-based Flask API tool to allow tracking of wins and losses for various card games on a per deck basis. The API allows a user to input the game, deck name, wins and losses to calculate win rate. This project was designed as a way to further explore both Python and Flask while gaining development knowledge and experience.

Future Development Goals:
  Host app on AWS
  Deploy with Zappa
  Store results to an AWS RDS instance for tracking results over time
